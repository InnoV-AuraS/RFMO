Source Code Report:

    This documentation includes a detailed explanation of the configuration steps and code usages necessary to make things work and
    understand how it works. The project directory includes a directory called "Dependencies" which contains all the necessary files
    for configuration but to do it manually please follow along with online tutorials.

Configuration:

    1. Frontend Configuration:

        The frontend files are the html , css and js files. They can be run on any browser as a standalone website. no extra configuration
        steps are necessary as long as you have a working browser or a local server(e.g. vscode live server).

    2. Backend Configuration:

        The backend files are the php files. To use php as your server side you must have a working php compatible server Server. For
        testing  purposes as in our case you can use the php server extension of vscode or third part packages like XAMPP. In our case we
        have setup php manually so we had to tweak some lines of code in the php.ini file in php download. for manual download please follow
        online tutorials else the dependencies folder contails the full php package necessary.

        The server we used is of configuration "localhost:3000". to use a different configuration you must make the necessary changes in
        frontend files.

    3. Database Configuration:

        The database we have used is MYSQL. to use it you must have it downloaded on the serverside. For testing purposes you must set up
        the database in your local computer. The necessary details must be filled up in db_config.php file. The database we have used is
        "rfmo_database". You can find it in the root directory.
