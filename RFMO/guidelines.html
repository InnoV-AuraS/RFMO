                <p>
                    A significant and essential component of tertiary education is research and its accompanying
                    activities.
                    The JIS University agrees with this assumption, and research is considered to be one of the
                    university's
                    core functions, along with teaching and volunteer work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The aforementioned three roles are interrelated and complementary to each other, making it necessary
                    to
                    constantly understand the relative importance of each, even though research is significant in and of
                    itself.

                <h2>1.2 Definition</h2>
                <p>
                    In this context, research is defined as any activity that aims to create one or more scientific
                    findings, such as knowledge generation, knowledge restructuring, and skills acquisition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on the primary objective for which the research is conducted, the creation and publication
                    of
                    research findings as well as the reading of research papers at professional conferences and seminars
                    are
                    included; the following examples may be distinguished:

                        might promote, co-promote, or supervise students, such as postgraduate and undergraduate
                        students.
                    </li>
                    <li>Staff employees that conduct research primarily to advance their educational credentials.</li>

                    <p>
                        Basic research is an innovative and methodical examination carried out primarily to advance
                        knowledge. Thus, the goals of basic research include the growth of knowledge, the identification
                        of new research areas, or the resolution or justification of issues fundamental to the fields of
                        knowledge.

                        Applied research is a creative and methodical examination with the overarching goal of
                        developing particular practical applications. Possible practical goals of applied research are
                        to identify potential applications for basic research or devise fresh approaches to attaining
                        precise, predetermined goals.

                    <p>
                        Developmental research is the methodical process of using prior knowledge obtained through
                        research and/or practical experience in order to design, evaluate, and adapt services,
                        processes, systems, materials, products, or devices with the intention of putting them into use
                        and/or manufacturing them, or to significantly improve existing ones. Development is focused on
                        creating new applications for knowledge as well as adapting and enhancing current technologies
                        in the fields of humanities and natural sciences, whether they are domestically produced or
                        imported.

                <h2>9. Policy for Obtaining Seed Money for Research (Amend on 2016)</h2>
                <p>
                    It is suggested that faculty members and aspiring researchers at the university receive early seed
                    funds in order to start their research facilities. The results of these studies will aid academics
                    who wish to submit large-scale research proposals to various funding bodies, including both public
                    and private institutions/agencies. It will inspire educators to actively participate in research
                    that also needs to concentrate on guiding PhD research scholars, postgraduate students, and
                    undergraduate students to carry out research. When providing projects with seed money, the following
                    procedures shall be followed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Grants and funding will be approved on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the demands of
                        the research project. The Doctoral Research Committee's choice to approve or disapprove a
                        research project will be final.</li>
                    <li>Faculty members having PhD and/or without PhDs are eligible to apply for funding.</li>
                    <li>The proposal should be distinctly focused on regional challenges, real-world applicability, and
                        academic growth of the parent organization in terms of outreach and research. Additionally, it
                        needs to outline the project's goals, strategies, deliverables, and results in the form of
                        publications, patents, etc.</li>
                    <li>The merits to be taken into account when sanctioning research projects will depend on:
                        <ul>
                            <li>a. The project's potential for application</li>
                            <li>b. The potential future application of the research findings</li>
                            <li>c. Any potential innovation based on study results</li>
                            <li>d. Paper publication and patent application scope</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Seed money can be used to purchase books, journals, chemicals, and can be used as contingency
                        funds. The use of a small grant is also permitted for fieldwork, surveys, and travel. Similar to
                        this, a small portion of the approved funds may also be used to pay service fees for analytical
                        purposes.</li>
                    <li>For projects in the sciences and engineering, the financing will not exceed Rs. 25,000.00 each
                        research project, and for projects in the humanities and social sciences, it will not exceed Rs.
                        10,000.00 each research project.</li>
                    <li>Using seed money will not be allowed for membership or subscription fees for any services,
                        filing fees for patents, or publication costs.</li>
                    <li>The project's maximum duration is one year, and it cannot be extended in any circumstances.</li>
                    <li>Should the teacher(s) or investigator(s) fail to finish the project, they must reimburse the
                        university for the whole sum sanctioned, plus interest at a rate of 10% annually.</li>
                    <li>The "Central Purchase Committee" will be used to carry out the purchases for research projects
                        funded by seed money.</li>

                    faculty members should not feel they have a right to it automatically. The Central Research Cell
                    (CRC), which will suggest the case for final approval by the Vice-Chancellor, will handle requests
                    for financial help or support for attending conferences.

                <h3>11. JIS University Policy on Intellectual Property</h3>

                <h4>11.1 Preamble</h4>
                <p>Technological advancement frequently manifests itself in inventions or designs as a result of applied
                    research and development. Such development is crucial for advancing the economy and raising the
                    standard of living. In order to ensure that all rights that may accrue are appropriately
                    safeguarded, usage or exploitation of such technological advancement is typically restricted to the
                    author or this person's nominee through adequate protection.</p>
                <p>An invention must be of a technical nature, innovative, inventive, and useful in commerce, industry,
                    or agriculture in order to qualify for patent protection, whereas a functional design must be
                    unique, not previously existing, and intended for industrial multiplication. Before filing a request
                    for the creation's protection, prospective inventors or designers should take precautions to prevent
                    disclosure of the relevant creation. Thus, before taking any action, members of the university
                    faculty are advised to conduct the necessary research.</p>

                <h4>11.2 Generic Principles of Policy</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The national laws governing intellectual property and its protection will always be acknowledged
                        and applied by the policy.</li>
                    <li>The University agrees to: Promote, encourage, and support all University-wide initiatives that
                        have the potential to lead to patents, usable designs, or other forms of relevant protection.
                    </li>
                    <li>Work together with all parties interested in producing relevant works that will benefit both the
                        University and those parties.</li>
                    <li>Create efficient systems and practices for acquiring the proper protection.</li>
                    <li>Make sure that any financial gains from the rights acquired via the appropriate creation are
                        distributed fairly.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>11.3 Assessment</h4>
                <p>All issues pertaining to the proper type of protection will be taken into consideration, advised on,
                    and decided by the inventors (where necessary an assessment committee can be established according
                    to the project). All disclosed information will be kept private and confidential. The Research Cell
                    will receive reports from the inventors.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Dean: Research and Development will: Keep a record of all patents and projects; evaluate
                        relevant works with relation to their practical and economic worth; and determine whether a
                        design or technology would be eligible for funding.</li>
                    <li>Give suggestions on how to make a product or functional design more marketable, feasible, and
                        operational.</li>
                    <li>Provide guidance on the University's engagement in the exploitation and registration of a
                        suitable creation.</li>
                    <li>Provide written notice of the University's decision to the staff no later than three months from
                        the creator's submission date.</li>
                    <li>Aid employees with legal contracts, such as those pertaining to secrecy and any agreements with

                <h4>11.4 Staff Members' Inventions</h4>
                <p>According to recognized legal principles, the University is entitled to any rights that result from
                    inventions or designs made by University staff members while they were working there. In this
                    regard, the University will take into account all submissions and advise the University (Executive
                    Management Committee) regarding the best course of action.</p>
                <p>If it is determined that an invention or a functional design was created outside the scope of one's
                    job, the university may still be entitled to remuneration if university equipment or other resources
                    were utilized.</p>

                <h5>Upon the creation of a suitable work in which the University may have a stake, a staff member may:
                </h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>Attend to filing a provisional patent application in the individual's name for an invention, and
                        then provide the committee with any necessary patent papers.</li>
                    <li>Ask the committee to set up the submission of a provisional patent application and provide it
                        with the necessary supporting papers.</li>
                    <li>If the design is functional, take care of filing a design application in your own name and then
                        presenting the committee with the necessary supporting papers.</li>
                    <li>Ask the committee to set up the submission of a design application and provide the necessary
                        supporting documentation. When the committee receives the necessary documents in any of the
                        aforementioned situations, it must be accompanied by the dean's or director's endorsement.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The committee may, if it is thought essential, designate a suitably qualified professional to handle
                    certain parts of obtaining protection or other relevant matters.</p>

                <h5>Financial Benefits</h5>
                <p>After all expenses incurred by the university have been paid, the following financial benefits will
                    be awarded from the commercialization of any ideas or designs in which the university has an
                    interest:</p>

                    <li>10% to the Department</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Prior to financial advantages being delivered, the University's costs and expenses will be
                    subtracted.</p>

                <h5>Additional Support</h5>
                <p>Staff members may ask the assessment committee for assistance with proper searches, exploitation, and
                    future development of the creation in cases where the university has an interest. The University
                    will handle any expenses in the manner described above.</p>

                <p>The University or a company or institution participating in the commercialization of the innovation
                    will accept full responsibility for all actions performed in order to obtain international
                    protection.</p>

                <h5>Ad Hoc Decisions</h5>
                <p>Ad hoc decisions regarding how to manage staff creations that also include students, study leaders,

                <p>Any fabrication, falsification, or plagiarism in the planning, carrying out, or reviewing of
                    research, as well as in the reporting of the research's findings, is considered research misconduct.
                    Honest mistakes or differences of opinion, authorship disputes without instances of plagiarism and
